## what is a mobile proxy?

If you're on this page, I am quite sure you already know what a 4g mobile proxy is. However, if you don't, here is a brief explanation.

In general, a proxy is a server that acts as an intermediary between your device and the internet. When you use a proxy, your device connects to the proxy server, and the proxy server connects to the internet. This way, the website you're visiting sees the proxy server's IP address instead of your device's IP address.

In particular, a mobile proxy is a proxy server that uses a mobile IP address. This means that when you use a mobile proxy, the website you're visiting sees the IP address of a mobile device instead of a residential IP address.

## why use a mobile proxy?

There are numerous reasons why you might want to use a mobile proxy. For example, I myself use them for web scraping purposes. Mobile proxies are great for web scraping because they are less likely to get blocked by websites than residential proxies. This is because websites are more likely to trust mobile IP addresses than residential IP addresses. 

Another reason you might want to use a mobile proxy is to access geo-restricted content. For example, if you're in the US and you want to watch a video that is only available in Europe, you can use a romanian mobile proxy to access the video.

## how to use a mobile proxy?

Using a mobile proxy really depends on your use case. For example, I use proxies in three ways:

1. with `curl` - whenever I quickly need to thest if a proxy works, I use `curl` to make a request through the proxy:\
```bash
curl -x http://$username:$password@$proxy.mihnea.dev:$port https://www.google.com
```

2. with [playwright](https://playwright.dev/) - I mostly use playwright for browser automation, and I use mobile proxies with playwright like this:
```ts
try {
    const browser: Browser = await chromium.launchPersistentContext("./tmp", {
        headless: true,
        proxy: {
            server: 'http://proxy.mihnea.dev:$port',
            username: '$username',
            password: '$password',
        },

    });
    const page: Page = await browser.newPage();
    await page.goto(url);
} catch (e: unknwon) { ... }
```

3. with [nst browser](https://www.nstbrowser.io/en) - an anti-detect browser I use for various social media projects.
